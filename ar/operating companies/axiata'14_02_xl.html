					Business Review 2014</h1>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						After a challenging 2013 due to intense competition, 2014 was a year of transformation for XL as the focus was on the merger and integration process with Axis. XL recorded revenue growth of 10% driven by strong data traction and the execution of key repositioning strategies. Data remains the fastest growing segment, increasing 42% YoY, contributing 29% to usage revenue compared to 23% in the previous year. Non-voice revenue (data, SMS and digital services) contributed 58% to total usage revenue, an increase from 54% a year ago. In addition, data traffic saw high growth of 127% YoY driven by increased smartphone penetration. Currently 16.1 million or 27% of XL’s subscriber base are smartphone users.
						<br/><br/>

						Overall, XL’s subscribers reduced slightly to 59.6 million from 60.5 million a year ago due to a price optimisation strategy that led to higher churn and a decline in lower-value subscribers whilst strengthening the existing customer base.
						<br/><br/>

						XL’s revenue composition continues to reflect consumers communication trend which is becoming increasingly data-centric. Over the last four years, XL has focused all its business transformation strategies to capitalise on the demand for data. Key transformation strategies were channelled towards building a robust new-generation data network, including commencing 4G LTE roll-out on a trial basis, and providing the best mobile data and digital services for its customers.
						<br/><br/>

						XL deployed 7,066 new BTS in 2014 bringing the total number of 2G and 3G BTS to 52,012. To ensure exceptional data experience and coverage for its customers, over 16,000 Node Bs were strategically positioned to cater to consumers demand for data.
						<br/><br/>

						Coverage for its 2G and 3G networks is now more than 90% and 40% respectively. From a capacity point of view, total capacity for 2G is now 10.28Gbps and total capacity for its 3G network is 238.49Gbps. Its BTS are also located strategically for easy traffic management without affecting network quality.
						<br/><br/>

						As data growth and smartphone adoption in Indonesia steadily increases, customers are also beginning to have higher expectations for better services and more non-traditional service offerings at affordable prices. To meet this demand and expectation, XL introduced a host of data-centric products and services in 2014.
						<br/><br/>

						As an extension to the success of XL’s Internet Unlimited package, a new starter pack, Internet Super Unlimited with a simple data package within fair usage limits, was introduced to target new data entry users before repositioning these users towards bigger volume packages tailored to their specific needs. 
						<br/><br/>

						Throughout 2014, XL continued to collaborate and offer bundling packages with smartphone manufacturers such as Apple, ASUS, Samsung, Blackberry, LG, Sony and Nokia. These bundling packages, coupled with XL’s network coverage and quality, offer a compelling value proposition to XL’s subscribers to enjoy affordable and enhanced internet experience.

					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">
						XL established partnerships with the best dealers by offering them exclusivity in managing its product distribution in the designated clusters. XL also implemented a “Best-in-class Distribution” strategy. As of end of 2014, XL has 65 partner agencies responsible for managing more than 220,000 independent retail outlets in 124 clusters. XL also has more than 5,000 non-traditional retail outlets with Mobile Data Service (MDS), the modern channel dealers who are responsible for managing more than 23,000 modern channel outlets.
						<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						XL increased its participation in retail outlets by more than 100% for sales of data service packages, from 75,000 retail outlets at the end of 2013 to 160,000 at the end of 2014.
						<br/><br/>
						As of 31 December 2014, XL operates 105 direct distribution channels through its XL Center. In addition to functioning as a direct product distribution channel, XL Center also disseminates information to the end users. By managing its own service centres, XL is able to monitor and improve customer service, quality of complaint handling and customer satisfaction index more quickly and accurately.
						<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="3">
						During 2014, XL Digital Services expanded its partnerships with key industry players to build an ecosystem. From 6,000 partners in 2013, it has now reached more than 10,000 partners. XL collaborates with leading strategic partners such as Alfamart (a well know department store network), Blue Bird (the largest taxi fleet), and Bank OCBC NISP, supporting its customers’ needs for a digital lifestyle. XL served more than 1,000 corporate customers and developed more than 75 portfolios in 2014.
						<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="4">
						XL’s digital entertainment platform, Gudang Aplikasi, provides over 18,000 applications for download and has more than 1.3 million registered users with more than 50,000 transactions per month and this continues to rise.
						Its M-Payment business through XL Tunai has over 130 registered merchants and a customer base of 1.3 million, an increase of 63% from the previous year. M-Banking also saw active subscribers grow 38% from the previous year and increased its bank partnerships to 50 from 40 in the previous year whilst also launching both Debit and Credit payments via Visa and Mastercard in July 2014.
						<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="6">
						Through XL Mads, XL expanded its mobile advertising solutions to the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) market with more than 500 SMEs currently using the service. Its M2M serves more than 509,000 subscribers while, via a collaboration with PT PLN (Persero), XL became the first mobile operator to provide a two-way smart metering system (SIMPLY, Smart Electronic Two-Way Meter Service).
						<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="7">
						XCloud maintains its position as among the top three cloud and data centre service providers in Indonesia, serving more than 40 corporate clients whilst its e-commerce platform, Elevenia has more than 18,000 sellers and over 2 million live listing of products.

					</p>
					<p class="sideTitle animated bounceInLeft" data-id="8">
In October 2014, XL became the first mobile operator in Indonesia to test 4G (LTE) spectrum with a connection speed of up to 100 Mbps. Two months later, XL launched 4G (LTE) services in four major cities namely Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bogor and Medan. 					
					</p>

				<div class="paragraph1 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<h1 class="title1  animated bounceInRight" data-id="1">Financial Performance</h1>
					<p class="content  animated bounceInRight" data-id="2">
						In 2014, XL recorded revenue of IDR23.6 trillion, a growth of 10.4% YoY driven by strong expansion in its data segment which grew 42% YoY. Usage revenue increased by 14% to IDR18.9 trillion, contributing 80% to total gross revenue.
						<br/><br/>

						EBITDA was stable totalling IDR8.6 trillion whilst EBITDA margin declined to 37% from 41%. This was mainly due to the integration with Axis after taking into account the negative EBITDA since its acquisition on 19 March 2014. Since the acquisition, XL has improved Axis’ cost structure with approximately 70% monthly reduction or IDR2 trillion annual savings.
						<br/><br/>

						XL recorded a net loss in FY14 amounting to IDR891 billion as a result of the Axis acquisition and the weakening rupiah. Excluding the impact from the unrealised forex transactions, XL would have recorded a net loss of IDR57 billion.
					</p>
					<h1 class="title1 minusMargin  animated bounceInRight" data-id="1">Outlook for 2015</h1>
					<p class="content  animated bounceInRight" data-id="2">
						XL’s acquisition of Axis is expected to drive industry consolidation and provide better service quality to its customers. More importantly, the additional spectrum will add to capacity and relieve the pressure on XL to build more sites, creating better capex efficiencies.
						<br/><br/>

						XL’s advantage lies in its technology and network readiness to cater to the surge in data consumption in Indonesia. To date, XL has one of the most advanced core networks in the market with next generation network capabilities. This allows XL to better manage capacity and network operations and is able to scale-up its network features to match the future technology requirements of Indonesian consumers.
						<br/><br/>

						With a stronger network that is 4G LTE ready and able to support future technology requirements from data usage, XL is looking to expand its data and digital business further over the coming years. XL believes it has the foundations in place for shaping its future as a leading mobile data service provider.
