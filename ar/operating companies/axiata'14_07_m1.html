					<h1 class="title1">Business Review 2014</h1>
					<p class="content">							
						The postpaid mobile segment remains the key contributor to M1’s revenue. This segment made up 62.0% of its total mobile customer base as at end of 2014 and contributed 88.1% to mobile telecommunications revenue. During the year, M1 added 19,000 postpaid customers to bring its postpaid base to 1,149,000, representing a market share of 24.5%. 
						<br/><br/>
						Mobile data usage continued to grow, driven by faster networks and devices. Average data usage per smartphone customer grew to 3.0GB per month in the fourth quarter of 2014, up from 2.5GB per month a year ago. Contribution from non-voice services increased to 47.3% of service revenue for 2014, up from 41.6% for 2013. As at end of 2014, 66% of M1’s postpaid customers had migrated to tiered data plans, compared to 49% a year ago. 
						<br/><br/>

						Through the year, the company continued to enhance and expand its products and services to cater to its customers’ changing needs. 
						<br/><br/>

						The growing appetite for data consumption led to an increased take up of data bundled plans. In September 2014, M1 discontinued its voice/message-only plans, and revised its data-bundled plans to offer more choices and bigger data bundles. Data add ons of up to 10GB were also introduced for customers with higher data needs. 
						<br/><br/>

						M1’s prepaid mobile service is mainly used by the migrant worker community, resident customers including parents who want to manage their childrens’ mobile usage, and transient visitors to Singapore such as business travellers and tourists.
						<br/><br/>

						In April 2014, IDA effected a regulatory change which reduced the number of prepaid SIM cards per customer from ten to three. As a result, M1’s prepaid customer base decreased to 703,000 as at end of 2014. 
						<br/><br/>

						During the year, the company introduced new prepaid products for tourists, including a 4G prepaid SunSurf data plan offering 1GB of local data with three days validity at an affordable SGD5. New Travel SIM Cards with local/IDD calls, message and data bundles, in SGD30 and SGD50 denomination, were also made available.
						<br/><br/>

						In extending its reach to the migrant worker segment, M1 organised Deepavali carnivals at recreation centres across Singapore and also participated in International Migrants’ Day celebration through a new collaboration with Migrant Workers’ Centre, during which the company promoted its 30 days 1GB Prepaid SunSurf plan in English, Mandarin, Bengali and Tamil, as well as educated the migrant workers on data usage. 
						<br/><br/>

						As at end of 2014, Singapore’s home fibre penetration rate grew to over 50%, up from about 40% a year ago. During the year, M1 continued to champion fibre services with the launch of competitive service plans and complementary services in both the residential and corporate segments and in the process, added 18,000 customers to bring its fibre customer base to 103,000. 
						<br/><br/>

						To cater to its customers’ increasing bandwidth requirements, M1 launched its 1Gbps residential fibre service plan at a promotional offer of SGD49 a month. This allows customers to enjoy greater value and superior usage experience, such as transfer of large files, high-definition video streaming and online gaming. 
						<br/><br/>

						In the corporate space, M1 was first to make available its 10Gbps service, the fastest fibre service on NGNBN, to cater to corporate customers with high bandwidth needs such as banks and cloud service providers. This was alongside the introduction of a competitively priced 1Gbps service. In addition, M1 broadened its suite of products and services, notably with the launch of a state-of-the-art data centre and enhanced cloud solutions through strategic partnerships with key technology vendors.

					<h1 class="title1">Financial Performance</h1>
					<p class="content">							
						For 2014, M1’s operating revenue increased 6.8% YoY to SGD1,076.3 million, on higher handset sales. Service revenue increased 1.4% to SGD831.1 million, driven by growth in postpaid mobile and fixed customer base, as well as higher revenue from mobile data. Revenue from non-voice services increased 5.7 percentage points to 47.3% of service revenue. Net profit after tax increased 9.7% to a record SGD175.8 million, with margin on service revenue increasing 1.7 percentage points to 21.2%. Free cash flow was lower at SGD93.2 million, due to higher capital expenditure and SGD40 million payment on spectrum rights. Net debt to EBITDA remained healthy at 0.8 times.	
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1 class="title1">2015 Outlook</h1>
					<p class="content">							
						With its advanced mobile and fixed networks and strong focus on customer centricity, the company is well positioned to capitalise on the growth opportunities in the industry. 
						<br/><br/>
						Data usage will continue to grow. From social media and online shopping to payment and cloud storage services anytime anywhere, online communications has become an intrinsic part of the digital lifestyle. Faster network and smarter devices will drive much of the growth in data consumption. 
						<br/><br/>

						With continual fibre adoption in both the consumer and corporate segments, there are opportunities for M1 to further grow its fibre customer base. The company will build on its broadened range of product and service offerings launched in 2014, as well as the Government’s initiatives to promote high-speed connectivity for businesses through the NGNBN, to further entrench its position in the fixed space, in particular, the corporate segment. 
						<br/><br/>

						Increasingly, mobile Internet connections are also being embedded in electronics, vehicles, household devices, signages, buildings and energy systems, as well as other devices to form the Internet of Things, and this is transforming the physical world into a giant, digital connected world. 
						<br/><br/>

						To ensure that the company is able to meet the future needs of its customers, M1 will continue to make the necessary strategic investments to enhance its product and service offerings, including investments into new smart solutions and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) platforms.
