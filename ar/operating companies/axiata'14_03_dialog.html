					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						Amidst the intense competition in key mobile and data space, Dialog further consolidated its position as the undisputed market leader in Sri Lanka’s mobile telecoms in 2014, recording a significant improvement in its financial performance. Dialog’s steady revenue growth supplemented with effective cost management initiatives translated to growth in profitability. Dialog demonstrated strong growth in revenue across Mobile, Digital Pay Television and Fixed Line businesses to record consolidated revenue of SLR67.3 billion for the year 2014 representing an increase of 6% YoY. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="3">
						The company, further strengthened its subscriber market share by 1.4 percentage points during the year. Dialog’s subscriber base reached 9.5 million at the end of year against 8.7 million in the previous year. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="4">
						The accelerated digitalisation and advancement of lifestyles is evident globally with the increased adoption of smartphones. In fast-tracking this transformation to Sri Lankan consumers, the company introduced an affordable series of Dialog branded handsets in 2014. Consequently, smartphone adoption has started to reach the critical mass which is reflected via growth in smartphone penetration within the Dialog network to 19% from 9% during the year.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="5">
						Mobile broadband services continue to grow rapidly, fuelled by the expanding range of applications and availability of affordable smartphones as well as data focused infrastructure investments. Accordingly data revenue grew by a strong 57% YoY while Dialog’s mobile broadband subscriber base grew by an impressive 66% YoY, confirming the competitive advantage the company holds in the broadband sphere. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="6">
						Dialog Mobile has island-wide 2G coverage with over 4,000 base stations. To cater for the exponential growth in data traffic, Dialog expanded its 3G and mobile 4G-LTE base stations by 12% during the year and upgraded capacity of the existing 3G network. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<br/><br/><br/>
				<div class="paragraph2 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">
						With the emergence of the new digital ecosystem, Dialog aspires to become the leader in Sri Lanka’s growing digital services industry. The company secured two global awards, ‘Best Technology Enabler Award’ and ‘The NFC &amp; Mobile Money Award’, at the 20th Mobile World Congress held in Barcelona in February 2015 for ideamart and eZ Cash respectively. Currently, over 850,000 Dialog mobile customers engage with the ideamart community. ideamart is the largest ecosystem in Sri Lanka which provides innovative solution to public and enterprises to create their own mobile applications and monetise using Dialog’s network.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						eZ Cash is Sri Lanka’s premier mobile payment network and has the distinction of being the first mobile money system in the world to be interoperable end-to-end across multiple service providers, bringing together a combined approachable base of over 14 million Sri Lankans. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="3">
						Dialog launched Digital Reach, an analytics-based digital advertising platform with built-in governance and ecosystem control which facilitates the implementation of Dialog’s digital advertising business of highly targeted multichannel campaigns for Sri Lanka’s leading brands and agencies. In addition, the self-service portal within Digital Reach enables the SME sector to realise the same benefits on a prepaid basis. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="4">
						Dialog Broadband Network (DBN) is a strong player in the fixed telecommunications market, offering multiple services to individuals and corporate clients including fixed telephony, broadband, Internet leased lines, data communications, hosted PABX offerings, Internet Data Centre and converged ICT solutions. DBN’s subscriber base at the end of 2014 was 427,000 and the Company further strengthened its presence in the enterprise sector by offering innovative solutions supported by 4G LTE technology and fibre.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="5">
						DBN launched Sri Lanka’s first fixed 4G LTE network in December 2012 to deliver high speed broadband to Sri Lankan homes and enterprises and continued to increase its geographical footprint during the year. The product has received wide acceptance since introduction and has experienced exponential growth. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="6">
						The company’s Pay Television business Dialog Television (DTV) is the only licensed Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite service provider operating in Sri Lanka with island wide coverage. It caters to the diverse infotainment needs of 452,000 households in the country with an estimated Pay TV market share of 77%. The business has promising prospects with low Pay TV market penetration in the country which is currently estimated to be less than 15%. DTV continued to exploit this opportunity and grew its base by 36% YoY.

				<div class="paragraph2 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<h1 class="title1 animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">Financial Performance</h1>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						Dialog’s PAT for the year 2014 grew by a significant 17% YoY to reach SLR6.1 billion which translated to a net PAT Margin of 9.1% on the back of strong improvement in EBITDA and the decrease in translational forex losses resulting from lower depreciation of the SLR against the USD during 2014 compared to the previous year.
						<br/><br/>

						Supported by the strong revenue growth and cost management initiatives, EBITDA for 2014 was recorded at SLR20.9 billion, an increase of 5% YoY while EBITDA margin was registered at 31.1%.
						<br/><br/>

						Dialog directed its investment strategy towards streamlining developments in High Speed Broadband Infrastructure and capacity growth. Hence, capital expenditure for 2014 amounted to SLR15.2bn focused towards investment in its 2G, 3G and 4G network, Optical Fibre Network (OFN) expansion projects and the Bay of Bengal Gateway (BBG) Sub-Marine Cable project to further strengthen the Group’s leadership in Sri Lanka’s ICT sector.

				<div class="paragraph2 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<h1 class="title1 animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">Outlook for 2015</h1>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						
						Sri Lanka’s telecommunications market will continue to be competitive in both voice and broadband services. The high speed broadband service sector demonstrates substantial growth potential considering the relatively low penetration level in the country. With its industry-leading 3G and 4G networks in operation, Dialog is well positioned to seize market opportunities in broadband and innovative products and services. 2015 will see Dialog fortifying its position as the leader in digital services in the country.
