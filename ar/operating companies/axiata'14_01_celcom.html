					<h1 class="title1">Business Review 2014</h1>
					<p class="content">
						2014 was a challenging year for the telecommunications industry in Malaysia. Amidst stiff market conditions, Celcom defended its subscriber market share whilst managed to contain revenue decline, stemming from an increase in price based competition, stringent measures to control content by switching off indiscriminate SMS broadcasts that led to a short term impact on revenue and limitations in the launching of new products during a substantial part of the year due to the ongoing IT transformation project. The IT transformation is aimed at achieving competitive advantage and delivering the best customer experience to Celcom customers in the long term. With the completion of the IT transformation project, Celcom is poised to introduce more innovative products in 2015. Celcom closed the year in the lead position with the highest number of mobile subscribers in Malaysia, at 13.0 million. Throughout the year, Celcom has been working closely with its MVNOs grow its share in various segments of the market. As a result, its MVNO subscribers grew by more than 65%, ending the year with over 3 million subscriber.
						<br/><br/>
						The company also defended its market leadership in mobile broadband, closing the year with close to 1.5 million subscribers, a growth of more than 20% YoY and capturing more than 40% of the market. The year saw strong growth in data services, now contributing 22% to revenue, a growth of about 24% from 2013. This uplift was driven by increased smartphone penetration and positive response towards attractive data services offerings. Smartphone users on Celcom’s network have also increased by 43% YoY. 
						<br/><br/>
						In line with consumers growing shift towards data, Celcom introduced a string of products such as a new post paid plan (Celcom First) and IOX (Internet of Xpax). Celcom also realigned its digital services and developed a clear strategic direction for digital money.
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="paragraph2">
					<p class="content">
						2014 also saw the completion of key milestones in Celcom’s entire network and IT transformation projects. Celcom continued its commitment towards strengthening its network advantage through nationwide deployment of various network modernisation initiatives. Celcom currently has more than 1500 LTE sites with plans to roll out more sites to better serve its subscribers. Several collaborative efforts with key industry players were also initiated with a view of building a more sustainable ecosystem that is cost-effective whilst providing optimum network coverage. 
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom has also been transforming its workforce with various initiatives towards developing its human capital. At the end of 2014, the company completed the structural re-organisation in line with its objectives of delivering the best in class experience to its customers.  All these are in line with its efforts to drive greater customer experience which has been acknowledged at industry awards such as 2014 Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Customer Experience Award.
						<br/><br/>
						Continuing with the shift towards digital services from 2013, Celcom took a substantial step leap beyond its core business in online shopping and digital entertainment. In 2014, Celcom worked with SK Planet Global Holdings Pte Ltd to successfully form a joint venture entity, Celcom Planet Sdn Bhd. Through this joint venture entity, an online market place 11street was created to complement  Celcom’s current e-commerce business, namely BachaBooku, TheCresent and Buzzar.
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom also provides, exclusive local content and personal entertainment through its subsidiary ESCAPE. At the same time, Celcom is focused in delivering new innovative services such as location based advertising to serve its sophisticated enterprise needs and enhancing its digital wallet to provide a single trusted wallet to manage all its customer’s digital payment needs in the future. In 2014, we migrated our mobile money service, Aircash, to a new platform. The new platform will offer better consumer experience as well as new services which will cater for smartphone user. For the future, it will look at mobile remittance know as Doowit and opportunities in the payment space.

					<h1 class="title1">Financial Performance</h1>
					<p class="content">
						After 31 consecutive quarters of excellent growth, the fourth quarter of 2014 was impacted by systems-related issues, a tightening of short code offerings as well as changing consumer behaviour with the increase of smartphone adoption. 
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom’s comprehensive IT transformation exercise, a major undertaking spanning all touch points from dealers, customer care to retail outlets, did have an impact on results but is set to ensure better customer experience whilst establishing a platform for growth in the long term.
						<br/><br/>
						Enhanced smarter spend initiatives and continued focus on cost structures resulted in a decrease in operating expenses by 4% YoY. Data continued to show good traction and is the fastest growing segment. Despite the overall sluggish market in 2014, data grew an impressive 24%, now contributing 22% of YoY total revenue from 17% in 2013, fuelled by a 50% increase in mobile internet revenue. Growth in the data segment was achieved on the back of an upsurge in smartphone penetration that climbed 15 percentage points to 47% from 32% a year ago.
					</p>
					<h1 class="title1 minusMargin">Outlook for 2015</h1>
					<p class="content">
						The telecommunications industry as a whole witnessed a decline in traditional mobile services, in particular for SMS and voice. Nonetheless, traditional mobile services was valued at over RM14 billion in 2014 and will continue to be a key revenue contributor to the mobile operators. 
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom is committed to strengthening its traditional telecommunications business along with other new growth areas that will allow the company to leverage on its existing strengths and assets.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="paragraph3 animatedParent">
					<p class="content">
						In 2015, Celcom will continue to focus on its current core activities or traditional services whilst concurrently enhancing its focus on mobile data and digital services. Data will be the main focus as data elements will be incorporated in all new product launches and prioritised for network roll out. Work is already in place to improve network quality and capacity to enhance customer data experience. Celcom intends to drive its data business by acquiring new customers, up-selling and increasing its smartphone uptake. Celcom is optimistic of sustaining growth via its innovative plans and 4G LTE will continue to play an important role to meet the exponential demand for data services and content. Celcom will also embark on the next generation of revenue stream with an emphasis on digital brands and solution businesses. Celcom will continue to invest in new core technologies to support its expanding infrastructure. 
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom’s Market &amp; Acquisition focus areas remains, with an emphasis on convergence and business adjacencies. With the proliferation of smartphone devices and the growing shift in consumer behaviour towards data and adjacent services, Celcom is expected to move up the value chain in order to capture higher growth and larger market potential. The company will continue to embrace OTT and digitalisation by building on its alliances and digitalising its businesses. The areas of focus is on the ‘new economy’ of content, convergence, M2M and solutions, digital advertising, digital payment and digital commerce.
						<br/><br/>
						Celcom’s business has always been centred on its customers. In 2015, Celcom will strengthen its relationship with its customers, for both consumer and trade, Celcom will continue to differentiate itself by building a platform to achieve the best in customer experience and this will be reflected through its products and services to its consumers. Hence, for 2015 more investments will be made towards its customer experience oriented infrastructure whilst concurrently transforming its cost structure to achieve smarter spending. 
						<br/><br/>
						Several key transformation initiatives that were operationalised earlier will translate into a stronger ecosystem to deliver better customer experience. Equal focus will be placed on customer experience and cost optimisation through several initiatives including industry collaborations, as well as focusing on data roll-out for all technologies towards building the best and most customer-centric network. All these are the key drivers behind Celcom’s commitment towards being the best mobile network in Malaysia.
