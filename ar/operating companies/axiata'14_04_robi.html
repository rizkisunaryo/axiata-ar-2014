					<h1 class="title1 animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">Business Review 2014</h1>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						Robi ended the year with a subscriber base of 25.3 million, which represents 21% of the subscriber market share.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="3">
						For 2014, Robi recorded revenue growth of 9.4% compared to the previous year. This was mainly from strong growth in data revenue of over 120%, supported by data usage growth of over 250% propelled by significant investments in its network to drive 3.5G and 2.5G data usage. Robi saw strong growth in 2014, faster than overall market growth, and strengthened its position as the second largest operator in terms of revenue market share in Bangladesh.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="4">
						EBITDA grew by 18.3%, whilst EBITDA margin improved by 2.9 percentage points to reach 38.3%. This was predominantly on the back of revenue growth and focused efficiency in cost structure. PAT increased by 20.4% despite additional operating expenses and depreciation from increased investments in spectrum and CAPEX to support the roll out of 3.5G network and expansion of 2.5G network. This was largely due to strong growth in EBITDA and focused investment strategy.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="5">
						The growth of data usage in the Bangladesh mobile telecommunications market is very encouraging and Robi has been at the forefront in introducing data products to address this development. Affordability being a very important factor, Robi was the first operator to offer 3.5G services at 2.5G rates. Robi’s Internet scratch card offer also proved to be a major draw for Robi subscribers. The biggest innovation came in the form of myNet. 
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="6">
						Robi organised a special Eid campaign whereby subscribers could contribute towards the purchase of new clothes for underprivileged children on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr by recharging a certain amount for their mobile phone number. By taking part in this initiative the subscribers enjoyed special bonus talk-time offer. The campaign was a great success in keeping with the practice of generosity and giving during the month of Ramadan.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br/><br/><br/>
				<div class="paragraph2 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">
						“Muktir Utshobe” a historical discount campaign was organised on the nation’s Victory Day whereby special handset bundles were offered to customers. This campaign was very successful in promoting the use of smartphones, a key factor in creating market for data usage in the country. In addition, Robi had special handset campaigns throughout 2014 in partnership with leading international smartphone makers such as Samsung and Apple to cater to the needs of the different consumer segments.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						In 2014, Robi recorded a revenue growth of 9.4%. This was made possible with the introduction of many new products. Special products targeting industrial workers were also launched. In addition, handset bundle offers for iPhone 6 and Samsung S5 were launched in partnership with handset makers Apple and Samsung.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="3">
						Launching of the bdapps has enabled the prospective young app developers of the county to get access to Robi’s entire subscriber base. The unique revenue sharing model used for the bdapps allows the app developers to get equal share of the revenue generated by the app uploaded onto bdapps platform. This certainly helps in promoting entrepreneurship among the young talented app developers of the country.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="4">
						Robi has launched the first-ever recharge brand named Robi Recharge Plus for all digital channels. It was the first operator to launch an airtime recharge facility through website services. The Recharge Plus platform allows mobile users to visit the designated online recharge gateway and recharge against the mobile number of their choice while payment is done through an online payment mechanism using a debit/credit card. This gives the consumers freedom to recharge their talk time without having to visit a physical recharge agent.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="5">
						Robi’s 3.5G service is now available in all 64 districts of the country. In order to popularise its 3.5G services, Robi initiated a 3.5G Experience on Wheel Campaign for its customers around the country. From the events, customers got a unique chance to experience the best-in-class Robi 3.5G service for free and gave the customers an opportunity to explore the internet on a smartphone. Customers were also offered voice and data products at very attractive prices.
						<br/><br/>
					</p>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="6">
						Robi continues to invest heavily to fast-track its 3.5G network and also to improve its 2.5G customer experience both in voice and data services. Robi has deployed over 2,400 3.5G sites. Total CAPEX investments made in 2014 amounted to BDT21.0 billion.

				<div class="paragraph3 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<h1 class="title1 animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">Financial Performance</h1>
					<p class="content animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						Robi continued its solid growth trajectory with strong growth across all financial metrics, outperforming the industry. YoY revenue increased by 9.4% with data revenue growing by more than 120% and now accounting for about 6% of total revenue against 2.9% in 2013. In tandem, EBITDA grew an impressive 18.3% and margin improved by 2.9 percentage points to 38.3%. Following suit, PAT for the year was also up 20.4% despite significant growth in related CAPEX investments. 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph3 animatedParent" data-sequence="300">
					<h1 class="title1  animated fadeInRight" data-id="1">Outlook for 2015</h1>
					<p class="content  animated fadeInRight" data-id="2">
						
						Against the backdrop of unprecedented growth in data business last year, 2015 looks very promising. Robi’s 3.5G data service is playing a major role in this exciting growth. Robi remains committed to investing in its network to ensure the best customer experience in data services. However, voice remains the mainstay of revenue source for the company. While Robi concentrates on expanding its data revenue, quality of voice service will not be compromised. 
						<br/><br/>

						In 2015, Robi plans to progress beyond being the market leader in a few regions and establish its self as a national brand by expanding market share in selected regions. Considering the low smartphone penetration, Robi has taken few market initiatives with great success. As the consumers are set to increase their usage of data, Robi believes its device strategy will help the company become the number one small screen operator. With operational excellence at the core of its initiatives, Robi aims to continue its journey to become the strong number two operator in the market in 2015.
