				Axiata established its digital service arm, Axiata Digital Services in late 2012 to place the Group in the same space as OTT service providers, enabling Axiata to expand its portfolio of services to cater to online customers on smartphones, tablets and fixed Internet. 
				<br/><br/>
				The move opens up new opportunities, to capture increased share of customer wallet and reach beyond Axiata’s traditional mobile services of its 260 million plus mobile subscriber base. By end 2014, Axiata Digital Services had gained significant traction and has now become a fast growing business segment for the Group. 
				<br/><br/>
				In the exploding digital ecosystem, Axiata’s participation in Digital Services anchors on the following:<br/><br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue uplift from Digital and OTT adjacencies to increase customer engagement within core mobile business<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement core mobile business with value creation opportunities by unlocking assets in its core business <br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transform the core to an OTT/IOT-ready business <br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build new skills and capabilities in the digital space across Axiata
				<br/><br/>
				To drive these strategic initiatives, Axiata Digital Services will focus on measured investments in four business lines; Digital Advertising, Digital Commerce, Digital Money and Digital Entertainment. 
				<br/><br/>
				Towards end 2014, Axiata Digital Services has built a strong and stable organisation with digital talent, skills and mindset developed in each of the countries. To further aid and strengthen its digital ecosystem, the Group launched the Axiata Digital Innovation Fund (ADIF), a RM100 million venture capital fund in partnership with Malaysia Venture Capital Management Berhad (MAVCAP). 
				<br/><br/>
				The fund is intended to encourage and spur innovation and growth of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem, helping companies in the digital services space with innovative products and market fit, through our extensive reach and knowledge of the region.
				<br/><br/>
				Similarly, in early 2015, Axiata launched its own Group-wide Application Programme Interface API Platform - Mobile Internet Fulfilment Exchange (MIFE). The radical open source digital enabler will accelerate engagement and partnership in Axiata’s digital strategy. 
				<br/><br/>
				Throughout 2014 and early 2015, Axiata Digital Services has made significant inroads in it digital services strategy. Some of the key achievements across Axiata Digital Services business lines in its operating countries are as follows:
