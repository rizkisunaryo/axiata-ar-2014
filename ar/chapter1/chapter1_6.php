	        	Dear Shareholders,
	        </div>
	        <div class="grey4Color" style="margin-top:10px;">
	        	In 2014, we continued to reshape the Group to realise our 2015 vision of becoming a regional champion and a leader, to meet our long-term financial and non-financial objectives. To that effect, we have worked hard on the financial results for 2014 whilst also developing new long-term opportunities and initiatives.<br />
	        	<br />
	        	<br />
						In 2014, underlying revenue growth, based on constant currency, remained robust and, with the the exception of one, all of our OpCos performed better than the industry. The Group continued to make progress in delivering our long-term strategy of building firm foundations for the future with substantial investments in new technology and capacity to accommodate the rapid demand for data. We have also accelerated our execution of new businesses with edotco, now one of the largest tower companies in the region, and digital services, our small but fastest growing segment. Axiata ended the year with healthy profit of RM2.3 billion (USD0.7 billion) and a very strong balance sheet which allowed us to increase dividend payout without affecting our ability to support future growth. We are confident that with the foundations in place, we will make our vision a reality whilst striving towards our 2020 target to be a new generation telco.

	        <div class="title maroonColor" style="font-size:21px; margin-top:30px;">
	        	The Group recorded stable revenue growth of 1.9%, 4.4% at constant currency, to RM18.7 billion. Stellar growth was posted by Smart, XL and Idea, up by 36%, 10% and 19% respectively.

	        	<span class="title maroonColor">Transforming Our Core Business</span><br />
	        	<br />
						The Group saw a mixed year with stellar results from most OpCos, especially Dialog, Robi and Smart, but Celcom’s previous exemplary track record was marred by its 2014 performance. Our affiliate, Idea, also performed extremely well. <br />
						<br />
						The Group recorded stable revenue growth of 1.9%, 4.4% at constant currency, to RM18.7 billion (USD5.7 billion). Stellar growth was posted by Smart, XL and Idea, up by 36%, 10% and 19% respectively.<br />
						<br />
						Data continued to be the main growth driver, up 31.5%. Data revenue showed strong growth in all markets driven by increased smartphone penetration. <br />
						<br />
						The Group’s EBITDA dipped by 3.7% to RM7.0 billion (USD2.1 billion). PATAMI in the year was RM2.3 billion (USD0.7 billion), down by 7.9% affected by Celcom’s performance, Axis acquisition costs at XL and the weakening Indonesian currency which fell 9% against the Malaysian Ringgit. Forex did have an impact with the US Dollar also rising against the Malaysian Ringgit and most other currencies in our portfolio. <br />
						<br />
						<br />
						Axiata ended the year in a position of strength with RM5.1 billion (USD1.6 billion) in cash and maintained a healthy balance sheet. Axiata’s Gross Debt to EBITDA ratio is now at a very healthy 1.99x.<br />
						<br />
						After an unprecedented 31 consecutive quarters of excellent growth, Celcom’s performance was primarily impacted by system related issues and other internal issues which saw revenue dip by 4% and normalised EBITDA by 6%. <br />
						<br />
						Celcom’s massive IT transformation exercise, a major undertaking and spanning all touch points from dealers, customer care to retail outlets, now at stabilisation stage, did have an impact on results but is set to ensure better customer experience whilst establishing a platform for growth in the long run. Data continued to show good traction, the fastest growing segment. Despite the overall sluggish market, data grew an impressive 24%, now contributing 22% to total revenue from 17% in 2013, fuelled by mobile internet revenue which was up 50%. Growth in the data segment was achieved on the back of an upsurge in smartphone penetration that climbed 15 percentage points to 47% from 32% a year ago. <br />
						<br />
						Robi, Dialog and Smart performed much better than the industry. Together they now account for 23% of the Group’s revenue and 22% of EBITDA compared to 20% and 17% respectively in 2013. <br />
						<br />
						Dialog demonstrated strong revenue growth across its  businesses of mobile, digital pay television and fixed line with revenue up 6%, EBITDA by 5% and PAT an excellent 17%. Similarly, Robi continued its strong growth trajectory across all financial metrics, outperforming the industry. YoY revenue increased by 9% with data revenue growing by more than 120%. In tandem, EBITDA grew by an impressive 18% and margin improved by 2.9 percentage points to 38.3%. PAT was up by 20% despite significant growth in related capex investments. Smart in particular saw an excellent year continuing to post stellar growth across all financial metrics. In a competitive market, revenue increased 36% and EBITDA by 61% whilst PAT more than doubled. Data revenue surged by 135% and now accounts for 22% of total revenue.

    	<div class="grey4Color" style="position:relative; z-index:10; padding:55px;">
    		<div style="width:545px;">
	    		Following suit, our regional affiliates also saw a good 2014. Idea reported all round strong performance for the 9 months FY14 with revenue increasing by 19% and M1 full year FY2014 at 7%. PAT for Idea and M1 was up by 63% and 10% respectively.<br />
	    		<br />
					XL saw a cautious return to form after flat growth in the previous year, posting an increase in gross revenue of 10% to IDR23.6 trillion (USD2.0 billion). This was primarily driven by an increased customer base from the Axis acquisition as well as a surge in data revenue of 42%. The year saw XL completing the integration with Axis,  well ahead of schedule, and performing better than the industry in terms of overall performance. In line with XL’s strategy of focusing on its core business, the year also saw the completion of sale of 3,500 towers to PT Solusi Tunas Pratama Tbk. (STP). The proceeds of IDR5.6 trillion (USD0.5 billion) will be used to pare down debt.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<span class="title maroonColor">Challenges, Opportunities And Outlook</span><br />
					<br />
					We continue to face challenges from the market, competition, regulatory and global economic conditions as our core business continues to be impacted. Competition with existing and new OTT players continues to emerge as a substitution to voice and SMS. <br />
					<br />
					Axiata has been preparing for this. Our diversified portfolio and strategy of focusing on the emerging and developed markets of Asia has put us in a strategic and strong position for long-term growth. The digital data revolution in our markets is now at the inflection point with the eco-system of high speed networks, smartphones, and applications in place. Asian smartphone penetration may rise substantially faster than growth rates for Europe and from a lower base in Axiata’s markets. This bodes well for the Group given our footprint and strategic investments in the past few years.

					<span class="title maroonColor">Expanding Our Core – Building A New Generation Telco</span><br />
					<br />
					<span class="title">Gearing up new business units</span><br />
					<br />
					2014 saw the Group shifting up a gear in our transformation strategy towards becoming a new generation telco, offering services beyond just voice and SMS. This was especially so in the execution of our new businesses, which have all shown excellent traction in the year. <br />
					<br />
					Axiata’s digital services unit, ADS, which supports the increasingly digital lifestyle of our consumers, is focusing on digital entertainment, digital commerce, digital payment and digital advertising services, continued to see accelerated progress. In 2012 and 2013 we had jumpstarted and laid the business foundations, and in 2014, we brought to market a number of new businesses which has seen early successes. This includes the digital commerce platform, Celcom Planet, a joint venture with SK Planet, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, building on the success of Elevenia, our partnership with SK Planet in Indonesia. Since its launch in March last year, Elevenia in Indonesia has shown huge success, attracting more than 20 million visitors per month. As of January this year, it has more than 18,000 sellers and two million product listings. <br />
					<br />
					Alongside this ADS also made successful inroads into the digital advertising space with its strategic joint venture with Adknowledge, Inc. to form Adknowledge Asia. The business works with brands, advertising agencies and app developers in Asia Pacific to provide them with data-driven advertising strategies, enabling ADS to tap into Asia’s fast-growing and lucrative digital advertising spend. In Indonesia, Adreach, our mobile advertising arm now serves over 350 brands, advertisers and agencies in delivering mobile and digital advertising to telco subscribers.<br />
					<br />
					Great progress was also made in Digital money with Dialog’s very successful eZ Cash about to be implemented in Cambodia and Bangladesh. The year also saw the launch of the Mobile Internet Fulfillment Exchange (MIFE), our own Application Programme Interface (API) platform, which will enable our OpCos to fully leverage emerging digital opportunities as part of their overall digital strategy. The service allows our potential digital partners faster integration into Axiata’s digital eco-system and assets. 
				</div>
				<div style="width:545px; margin-top:20px;">
					To further aid the digital ecosystem, we launched the Axiata Digital Innovation Fund (ADIF), a RM100 million (USD31 million) venture capital fund in partnership with Malaysia Venture Capital Management Berhad (MAVCAP). The fund, which will see Axiata committing RM50 million (USD15 million), is part of our corporate social responsibility and is intended to encourage and spur innovation and growth of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem, helping companies in the digital services space with innovative products and market fit, through our extensive reach and knowledge of the region.<br />
					<br />
					Alongside this, Axiata’s passive infrastructure company, edotco Group, saw significant progress in 2014. It has now grown its tower portfolio in excess of 13,000, as of end 2014, and increased tenancies by 12.3%. In all countries run and managed by edotco, there has been steep improvements in operational efficiency and Capex resulting in savings of RM25 million (USD8 million), on structures and energy and efficiency improvements.<br />
					<br />
					<span class="title">Improving cost structure</span><br />
					<br />
					With around RM4 billion (USD1.2 billion) spent in network capex and more than RM1.5 billion (USD0.5 billion) in network opex yearly, reducing the cost structure of our operations remains a priority.<br />
					<br />
					The re-organisation of procurement and treasury operations into centralised business operations for the group, continues to progress well. The Axiata Procurement Centre (APC) focusing on optimising our Network and IT expenditure, entered into strategic framework arrangements with our key network suppliers – Ericsson, Huawei, NEC, and SIAE. The agreements will enable our OpCos to realise business efficiencies and competitive advantage by optimising their demand and capitalise on group-wide pricing. APC consolidated the demand across five countries in the region and negotiated group pricing arrangements covering all Axiata markets. APC established a target to save USD150 million over a three year period and in 2014 delivered savings of USD78 million which is half way to the three year target and 52% greater than the 2014 KPI.<br />
					<br />
					We have also institutionalised an advanced and focused mechanism for the effective deployment and tracking of incremental technology capex/opex for improved productivity. Alongside this, efforts to modernise the networks in every OpCo, especially the migration from legacy technology built for voice, to all internet protocol (IP), continued in a phased manner, to ensure more efficiency.<br />
					<br />
					Group-IT completed the IT Architecture and Blueprint initiative, started in 2013, which looks to harmonise technology across the Group, for cost and operational efficiency. The outcome of this project has provided detailed inputs to every OpCo regarding technology refresh, new capabilities buildup and sun-setting roadmap in order to proactively advance IT capabilities, keeping in view the business requirements of the Group in the next three years.
				</div>
				<div style="margin-top:40px;">
					<span class="title maroonColor">Continued Recognition From Peers</span><br />
					<br />
					Our commitment and performance has led to our group of companies being recognised by peers and watch groups not only in their own countries, but also regionally. I am pleased to note that Axiata and our subsidiaries again dominated the awards ceremony at the Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific ICT Award 2014. Axiata Group won the Best Telecommunications Group for the sixth consecutive year. This prestigious award is granted to the operator with presence in at least four Asia Pacific markets that has shown exemplary growth and performance in 2013 through its investments in the region. Axiata Group also took home three awards in total with XL winning the Most Innovative Telecom Service Provider of the Year and Dialog was voted Best Emerging Market Service Provider of the Year. Axiata Group also took home two awards at the 2015 Global Mobile Awards, which were presented at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Dialog won the Mobile Money Award for eZ Cash and the Best Technology Enabler Award for the MIFE platform, Ideamart.<br />
					<br />
					The awards are an acknowledgement of the continued success of our OpCos not just in the region but internationally, as well as an acknowledgement of the Group’s progress towards its regional ambitions.
				</div>
				<div style="position:relative; margin-top:40px; width:540px; left:310px;">
					<span class="title maroonColor">A Regional Champion</span><br />
					<br />
					We are now entering our watershed year of 2015 where we aim to meet our regional aspirations, as a truly Malaysian grown multinational. Axiata is today one of the largest Asian telecommunications companies with presence in eight countries. Since inception, Axiata has grown our subscriber base by more than six times to serve over 260 million people, revenue for the Group increased 87% to RM18.7 billion (USD5.7 billion), PAT by 66% to RM2.3 billion (USD0.7 billion) and market capitalisation has increased more than two times to RM60.5 billion (USD18.5 billion). I am happy to note that not only are we are on track to meet our regional ambitions, we have put in place foundations to meet the challenges and opportunities in the industry today preparing the Group beyond 2015 for the new digitised world.<br />
					<br />
					Whilst we remain cautious given the challenges and increased competition expected in the industry, we will be aggressively moving into our next phase of becoming a leader in mobile data and positioning for a new business model. We will be investing significantly to transform our core looking at, amongst other things, customer relationships, distribution, customer care, pricing innovation and new skills. This will be alongside a focus on data profitability as well as looking at new cost structures. <br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<span class="title maroonColor">Acknowledgements</span><br />
					<br />
					On behalf of the management of Axiata Group, I would like to express our thanks to our many stakeholders including investors, partners and the media for their continued support, as well as governments and regulators for their co-operation and facilitation in growing our businesses in their respective countries. Our most sincere gratitude to all our colleagues across Asia, who have worked tirelessly to get us to where we are today; and to our Board of Directors for their guidance in setting the strategic direction for the Group. Most of all, we would like to acknowledge our over 260 million customers for their continued support and loyalty.<br />
