            <div style="position:relative; margin-top:10px;">
              Our journey towards realising our ambition to be a regional champion by 2015 is fast approaching its mark. I am pleased to report that Axiata has upheld its promise - raising the performance bar whilst remaining committed to its transformation into a new generation telecommunications company by 2020.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
							Since inception, we grew our subscriber base by more than six times to serve more than 260 million people in eight countries and our market capitalisation has increased by more than two times to RM60.5 billion (USD18.5 billion). Axiata’s share price performance continues to remain resilient, closing at RM7.05 at the end of 2014. Today, Axiata is one of the largest and most respected Asian telecommunications companies.<br />
							<br />
							These achievements are only the beginning of our journey. We are now entering the second phase of our journey, making bold moves and embracing new business models towards achieving mobile data leadership, paving the way to become a truly digital company. More specifically, we have put in place new growth strategies, driving continuous improvements to our businesses and operating models, and built new and stronger management teams, in our bid to become a ‘New Generation Telco’ by 2020. This is in the face of the rapidly evolving mobile industry as well as increased competition from existing players as well as Over-The-Top (OTT) players invading our space and emerging as a substitution to our services. <br />
							<br />
							2014 was a challenging year, especially at Celcom. In addition, the Group, as with most regional companies, was impacted by adverse forex movements. The Group has nonetheless delivered overall healthy performance. This is a reflection of prudent cash management as well as a diverse portfolio. Our sustained underlying performance and strong cash position has allowed the Group to provide healthy returns to shareholders through a total dividend payout of 22 sen per share for the financial year ended 2014. The Group will continue to maintain a healthy dividend payout subject to overall financial performance, capital requirements, growth expansion strategies as well as dividends received from subsidiaries. <br />
							<br />
							<br />
							<span class="title maroonColor">Commitment to Sustainable Long Term Value Creation across Five Countries</span><br />
							<br />
							As we steer forward and strive to push our business to greater excellence, Axiata remains committed to bring value and strong contributions to societies in which we operate, as one of the top contributors to each of the respective countries’ economies.<br />
							<br />
							In the last seven years, to support our business activities, we have spent more than USD8.3 billion in capital expenditure and created more than 1.5 million jobs. This has translated into an estimated USD93 billion in direct and indirect economic contribution. <br />
							<br />
							Beyond our business activities, we continue to make an impact to the communities and countries in which we operate especially, but not limited to, education, leadership development and digital inclusion. In 2014, we further enhanced our commitment in the areas of disaster preparedness. Axiata was one of three founding signatories of the GSM Association Mobile Industry Humanitarian Connectivity Charter that was signed in Barcelona in March 2015.<br />
							<br />
							We remain focused on adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency and sustainability reporting. Axiata’s recognition at the Malaysia-ASEAN Corporate Governance Index 2013 awards for Top 5 Overall Corporate Governance for the second year in a row is testament to this. I also am proud to announce that Axiata has been recognised with two awards in recognition of our commitment to sustainability. Both awards were within a year of publishing our first sustainability report, against the GRI G4 framework. We are the first telco in Malaysia, and one of the first globally, to benchmark against this international framework.<br />
							<br />
							<br />
							<span class="title maroonColor">Continued Recognition of Management Excellence</span><br />
							<br />
							Alongside these awards, I am happy to note that Axiata’s outstanding leadership continues to receive local and international recognition. It gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity to congratulate Dato’ Sri Jamaludin, President and Group CEO, who was honoured with two very distinguished awards in 2014 for CEO of the Year at the MSWG-Asean Corporate Governance Transparency Index Awards as well as Malaysia’s Outstanding CEO 2014, at the Edge Billion Ringgit Club. Most recently in March this year, Dato’ Sri Jamaludin was the recipient of the 2015 GSM Association Chairman award which recognises outstanding personal contribution to the growth and development of mobile communications around the world. The awards are an acknowledgement of his leadership and valuable contribution in shaping Axiata into one of Asia’s most successful mobile networks. <br />
							<br />
							This year, I am very pleased to welcome back Dr Muhamad Chatib Basri to the Axiata Board of Directors line-up. Having served as the Chairman of the Investment Coordination Board and subsequently as the Minister of Finance of Indonesia, Dr Chatib brings with him a wealth of experience and knowledge of Indonesia, one of our biggest markets in the region. In addition, he brings invaluable expertise in international trade and macroeconomics which extends beyond Asia, an important addition to Axiata as we continue our journey as a regional champion.<br />
							<br />
							<br />
							<span class="title maroonColor">Acknowledgement</span><br />
							<br />
							On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our various stakeholders for their support during the year. As always, special mention of thanks for the facilitation and co-operation of the governments and regulators in the countries of our operating companies (OpCos). The Board also wishes to thank every employee and the management teams across the Group, our shareholders who continue to believe in our strategy of disciplined growth to strengthen the foundation for the future and our over 260 million customers across the region.<br />
							<br />
							It thus gives me great pleasure to present to you the 2014 Annual Report of Axiata Group Berhad.<br />
							<br />
