                We define material issues based on whether they have an impact to our business in either economic, social or environmental aspects and their relevance to our stakeholders across the Group. 
                <br>
                <br>Identifying Key Issues
                <br>Our process to identify key material issues is based on the Reporting Principle and Guidance for Defining Content in the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting framework. The sources used to identify the key issues that are material to the Axiata Group and our stakeholders in the reporting period are depicted in the table below.
                <br>
                <br>The key issues were then prioritised and plotted on a materiality matrix using the external and internal parameters as shown below.
