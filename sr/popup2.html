				<b>M1</b><br/><br/>
								
				M1 is Singapore’s leading communications company, providing mobile and fixed services to close to two million customers. Established in 1997, M1 achieved many firsts, including being the first operator to offer a nationwide 4G service, as well as the first to provide ultra-high-speed fixed broadband, fixed voice and other services on the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (NGNBN). With a continuous focus on network quality, customer service, value and innovation, M1’s mission is to link anyone and anything; anytime, anywhere.
				<br/><br/>
				M1 has a longstanding commitment to conduct its business in a responsible and sustainable way, and to play a meaningful role in the well-being of all stakeholders, and the community in which it operates. M1’s approach to sustainability is built around three key areas:
				<br/><br/>

				<b>Network access and coverage</b><br/><br/>

				M1 has invested more than SGD1.6 billion in expanding and upgrading mobile network infrastructure, including resiliency enhancement and implementation of the latest technology. These investments enabled M1 to launch Singapore’s first nationwide 4G network in 2012, as well as the first 300Mbps nationwide LTE (Long Term Evolution) Advanced network in 2014.
				<br/><br/>

				In 2014, SGD140 million was committed to upgrading networks and systems, as well as to construct a building extension. 
				<br/><br/>

				<b>Ethics and integrity</b><br/><br/>
				M1 engages in fair, transparent and responsible business practices in dealings with all stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and business partners. The company complies with all regulatory requirements, and aims to meet or surpass the expectations of customers.
				<br/><br/>

				This includes promoting transparency in business practices including marketing, communications, recruitment, procurement and ensuring data privacy. Maintaining a high standard of corporate governance is key to protecting the interests of stakeholders, including customers, employees, business partners and shareholders.
				<br/><br/>


				<b>Nurturing People</b><br/><br/>
				Ensuring a safe and conducive working environment and providing relevant training are key to M1’s sustainable business practices. The company has a merit-based recruitment and promotion policy and management and employees work together to identify suitable and relevant training programmes to enhance employees’ skill sets.

					<h1>Reducing the Environmental Footprint</h1>
					M1 conducts its operations efficiently, so as to minimise its environmental footprint and to make effective use of limited resources.
					<br/><br/>
					Base station operations are reviewed periodically to identify ways to reduce energy consumption. In 2011, the company completed its 2G base station modernisation programme to replace 1,200 base stations with multi-radio ones that do not require air-conditioning, yielding power savings of 6,876,600kWh a year.
					<br/><br/>

					Solar photovoltaic (PV) power systems were installed at base station sites on Pulau Satumu and St. John’s Island to reduce the use of diesel, in 2012 and 2014. These generated power savings of 5,687kWh in 2014, and depending on weather conditions, are expected to generate an estimated 10,000kWh in a power supplement annually.
					<br/><br/>


					<h1>Some Key Initiatives</h1>
					<h1>Delivering Advanced Technology Sustainably</h1>
					In 2014 M1 launched the next-generation data centre offering state-of-the-art features previously only available to large corporate users, such as “cold aisle” containment, as well as temperature, humidity and power utilisation sensors on all server racks, to a wide spectrum of customers from large corporates to small and medium enterprises. 
					<br/><br/>

					<h1>Protecting Children</h1>
					M1 takes special measures to protect vulnerable customers such as children and youth from undesirable content, and worked with the other mobile operators to create the Voluntary Code of Self-Regulation of Mobile Content in Singapore, to protect minors from accessing prohibited content via mobile phones. A variety of tools have been made available to parents to monitor the access of their children to sites online.
					<br/><br/>

					<h1>Customer Experience</h1>
					Providing excellent customer service is one of M1’s core tenets and the company continually invests in training to ensure a positive customer experience across all touch points of its business operations. All new employees undergo an attachment at the customer contact centre and retail outlets during their orientation programme.
					<br/><br/>

					<h1>Enabling Communications for People with Special Needs</h1>
					M1 has supported People Living with Disabilities since 2000, with the launch of Singapore’s first customised mobile plan featuring an enlarged SMS bundle, to meet this community’s needs.
					<br/><br/>

					In 2011, this plan was enhanced with a data bundle to cater to smartphone usage. Following a further review in 2014, M1 launched ConnectSurf, Singapore’s best-value plan for this community, with a specially designed voice, SMS/MMS and data bundle at a highly affordable price.
					<br/><br/>

					<h1>Underserved Communities</h1>
					In 2014 the company worked with the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) to help low-income households enjoy free access to digital free-to-air TV programming. In this project, M1 supplied and installed DVB-T2 (Digital Video Broadcasting – Second Generation Terrestrial) set-top boxes to eligible households, allowing them to access and enjoy the improved video and sound quality of digital TV programming.
					<br/><br/>

					<h1>Supplier Code of Conduct</h1>
					To promote ethical practices on the part of suppliers, M1 commenced work on a M1 Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014. This Code sets out M1’s expectations of suppliers, including the need to comply with all applicable laws, prohibition on illegal or unethical behaviour such as bribery and corruption, and protection of customer data. The Code will be implemented in 2015.
