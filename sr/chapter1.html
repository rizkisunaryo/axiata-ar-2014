			<p class="topic1">
				We published our first Sustainability Report according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI – G4) guidelines in 2013. The 2013 report titled ‘<b>Our Commitment to Development</b>’ explained Axiata’s approach to promoting sustainability within the Group’s. This year’s Sustainability Report, ‘Our Commitment to Development: Building Digital Ecosystems’ continues the narrative from 2013.

			<p class="topic2">
				Our industry has moved from facilitating voice and short messaging services to a dynamic new digital platform where the services we support empower communities in which we operate. This report discusses the approach followed by the Group to create sustainable digital ecosystems within the each of our four sustainability pillars.<br/><br/>

				In this year’s report, we discuss our journey towards creating sustainable digital ecosystems by examining four key aspects: the improvements we have engineered; the innovations we have unleashed; the investments we have made; and the impacts we have had. <br/><br/>

				This report will disclose the developments in each of the pillars in four different aspects. They are

			<h2 class="title2">Forward Looking Statements</h2>
			<p class="topic4">
				This report contains forward-looking statements characterised by the use of words and phrases such as “might” “forecast” “anticipate”, “project”, “may”, “believe”, “predict”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “estimate”, “target,” and other similar expressions. Our business operates in an ever-changing macro environment. As such, our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the expectations of the Group and may or may not turn out as predicted.

			<br/>
			<h2 class="title2">Changes from Previous Report</h2>
			<p class="topic4">
				Our 2013 report scope did not include the passive infrastructure of our operations currently managed by edotco, covering a network of over 13,000 sites in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. This report, however includes and discusses the impact of these operations and discloses sustainable measures taken currently within edotco as well.

					<p class="leftSec">Last year Axiata took further steps to enable sophisticated digital ecosystems for our 260 million customers. Our rural footprint grew as we expanded network coverage to X% and made <b>connectivity</b> more affordable to diverse social segments. We have facilitated access to state-of-the-art digital <b>technology</b> through low cost and high-end devices brought forth by our world class <b>talent</b> pool of 29,000 people across the region.
					<br/><br/>
					This report focuses on Axiata’s four sustainability pillars: ‘Beyond Short-Term Profits’; ‘Nurturing Our People’; ‘Inculcating Process Excellence’; and ‘Responsibility to Planet and Society’, report examines each of these four pillars and reports on how the Group has been adding value in each of these areas.

			<div class="section4">
				<h1 class="header0">BEYOND SHORT TERM PROFITS</h1>
				
				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Long Term Investment</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Our investments go back more than 20 years in Bangladesh, 19 years in Sri Lanka and 17 years in Cambodia. Our business focus has always been on long term value creation rather than on short term gains. We have been the leading investor in long term growth in all our different markets.
					<br/><br/>
					Across our Network, we have invested RM4 billion in capital expenditure last year, increasing connectivity, enhancing reliability, and facilitating access. We are the leader in introducing new technology to our markets. Last year, we became the first operator to introduce LTE to Cambodia and the first 3G enabled operator in Bangladesh. We ensure that new technology and connectivity is not only limited to the urban areas in our footprint. XXX towers constituting xx% are currently positioned in the most remote areas of our OpCo countries.
				</div>
				<br/><br/>
				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Services beyond Commercial Motivation</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Our digital services portfolio has contributed significantly to enhance the creation of a digital ecosystem built around the idea of inclusion. In 2014, we have seen growth in our M-money, M-commerce, M-insurance and other Mobile innovations. The number of M-money users grew by xx% in Sri Lanka, a total of XX subscribers are currently using our M-commerce initiatives across the group while xxx of our subscribers are insured via our M-insurance. Ideamart the platform for digital innovation in Sri Lanka was identified by GSMA as the Best Technology Enabler for 2014.
				</div>
				

				<br/><br/>

				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Supporting Digital Ecosystems</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Last year we launched the MYR100 million Axiata Digital Innovation Fund (ADIF). The Fund aims to spur innovation and the growth of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem. ADIF will aid companies in the digital services sector with innovative products and market fit. These companies, although revenue generating, require support to grow in terms of funding, know-how and market access. Through Axiata’s extensive reach of over 13 million customers in Malaysia and over 260 million across Asia, Malaysian digital services entrepreneurs will have unprecedented access to funding and regional partnership opportunities. While Axiata has been growing significantly, we consider it our responsibility to spur other Malaysian companies to become successful as well. This is very much in line with our goal of ‘Advancing Asia’ through connectivity, technology and talent.
				</div>
				
				<br/><br/>

				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Global Mobile Development</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Axiata remains active in its role in GSMA’s Mobile for Development efforts. Through its initiatives, Axiata is provided the opportunity to work alongside global peers in the GSMA, enabling relevant, impactful services that connect people, transform daily lives and improve sources of income. Last year, Axiata supported GSMA’s partnership with Child Helpline International with each of our OpCo’s exploring options to support the Child Helpline in their respective markets. At the recently concluded Mobile World Congress, we joined GSMA and three other global peers for the launch of the Humanitarian Connectivity Charter as a founder partner.

					<h1 class="header0">NURTURING OUR PEOPLE</h1>
					
					<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Nurturing Future Leaders</h1>
					<div class="paragraph">
						Nurturing talent remains a leading focus for the Group. By the end of 2014 we had more than 29,000 employees across the Group. We will continue to encourage innovation, develop new talent and invest in developing future leaders for the company and the industry. Our goal is to build new leaders to drive the future of the Group as well as the industry. Last year, 950 employees were part of our accelerated development programmes.<br/>
						In 2014 we conducted the first ever ‘Axiata Champions’ programme. Fifty of the top performers across the Group were given the opportunity to interact and learn from the leaders in the industry. This was in recognition of the exceptional performance of these key contributors. The Axiata Champions was also an event marking the establishment of our core values, uncompromising integrity and exceptional performance, across the group.
						<br/><br/>
						The Axiata Young Talent Programme (AYTP) has evolved into trailblazing initiative. We have invested RM100 million in this initiative and it has attracted more than 14,000 applicants in 2014 alone. In Indonesia, the programme is known as the XL Future Leaders programme and has benefitted more than 400 young people so far.

					<br/><br/>
					<h1 class="header0">INCULCATING PROCESS EXCELLENCE</h1>
					<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Strong Governance and Supply Chain Management Best Practice</h1>
					<div class="paragraph">
						We constantly strive to enhance our business processes. This includes having open and transparent internal processes and engaging with third parties to encourage them to adopt processes that are transparent and ethically fair. Axiata received recognition yet again at the annual Malaysia – ASEAN Corporate Governance Index 2014 awards recognising our governance structure.
						<br/><br/>
						In 2014 we paid particular attention to improving our relationships with our suppliers. Suppliers are an integral part of every business operation and help shape innovative products and customer satisfaction. Our engagements with our suppliers have focused on ensuring that their processes are in line with the Axiata values on sustainability. We will continue to engage with them and support them in the integration of best practices in their operations. In 2014 we launched the Axiata Supplier Forum. We intend to use this as our main conduit to engage our suppliers on best practices. We will regularly streamline the processes of this forum to ensure transparency, participation and efficient outputs. In Malaysia, more than 50% of our CAPEX is spent on procurement from local vendors.
					</div>
					
					<br/><br/>

					<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Digitisation</h1>
					<div class="paragraph">
						We will soon establish a new KPI across the Group in 2015, in order to digitise our processes in each of the operating companies where this is permitted by the respective country regulatory systems. We target to be a fully digital company by 2020. This means that we will transform our core process for interacting with our customers and employees in a digital way.
						<br/><br/>
						As we embark on this journey, we have started to reflect this process in this year’s sustainability report as well as our annual report now available on digital applications. Last year more than 6,000 readers accessed our Annual and Sustainability reports using the digital application and the web version, which is almost twice the number of hard copies printed. By the end of 2015 XX% of our processes will be available digitally. We will start this process internally with the employee communication platform ‘Prism’ which will enable group-wide communication and networking on a digital platform.

				<h1 class="header0">RESPONSIBILITY TO PLANET AND SOCIETY</h1>
				
				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Greener Operations</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Our commitment to environmental sustainability remains a priority. There can be no sustainable businesses without sustainable environments. Similarly, there can be no sustainable businesses without sustainable societies. We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our operations and to empowering society through our activities.
					<br/><br/>
					‘edotco’, our infrastructure company was launched in 2013 with a view to creating greener digital networks. One of ‘edotco’s’ goals is to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2018. Last year we learnt immensely how we could achieve this goal. Whilst this is a very challenging and aspirational goal, we currently have X concurrent projects and field trials ongoing with a view to achieving this.
					<br/><br/>
					One of these initiatives has already enabled us to manage key operations of some of our towers remotely. We have established the ‘Echo Centre’ in Malaysia which looks into managing rural sites including tasks such as regulating power consumption, managing cabin temperature, and measuring fuel and battery capacity. We plan to establish this system across the Group in the coming years. Along with edotco’s green mandate, XXX towers of our network are currently run by renewable energy sources.
				</div>
				<br/><br/>
				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Society</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Each of our operating companies champion key corporate responsibility initiatives in the different countries in which they operate. Education has always been a key focus area of the Group. In Sri Lanka, more than 50,000 students benefited from having free access to the educational channel ‘Nenesa’ whilst rural schools in Bangladesh were able to access English learning programmes through the English in School programme. ‘Nenesa’ was able to make use of Dialog TV to provide high quality educational programmes to rural communities across Sri Lanka. In Bangladesh Robi saw a dearth of English language skills and focused on filling this gap and helping build global digitised ecosystem.

				</div>
				
				<br/><br/>

				<h1 class="header1">Our Commitment to Disaster Preparedness</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Our operating companies happen to be located in many areas that are prone to natural disasters. ‘Disaster Management and Response’ has been identified as a priority area for 2015 and beyond. Developing participatory processes that can respond to and mitigate the impact of disasters is very much a part of this initiative. As part of our commitment to the Humanitarian Connectivity Charter, we will work closely with the GSMA looking at industry-wide best practices that can be adopted before, during, and after a disaster.
					<br/><br/>
					In Malaysia Celcom in re-established its network in a matter of XX hours after the recent floods in East Malaysia. A sum of RM1.2 million was spent to ensure that customers had adequate support after the disaster. In Sri Lanka, Dialog’s DEWN project has set a new benchmark for disaster preparedness.
					<br/><br/>
					Our 2013 Sustainability Report was our first attempt to benchmark our operations against world class reporting standards indicating our commitment to development. Over the past year we have developed our reporting process while encouraging our OpCos to publish standalone reports for their respective markets.
					<br/><br/>
					This is our second report produced in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, where we discuss our management approach to sustainability and document the achievements of our Group over the past year. Axiata remains committed to enhancing its sustainability processes, to delivering high value to its customers and other stakeholders, and to Advancing Asia. We will pursue these goals with undiluted commitment in 2015 and beyond.

				<h1 class="header0">Approach</h1>
				<div class="paragraph">
					In our 2013 Report we introduced Axiata’s commitment to triple bottom line management (economic, environmental and social) in line with our broader goal of Advancing Asia. Our approach is driven by our four sustainability pillars: ‘Beyond Short Term Profits’, ‘Nurturing People’, ‘Process Excellence’ and ‘Planet &amp; Society’. In 2014, we continued to refine our approach to sustainability, fine-tuning the operations under each of these pillars. Each of our OpCos follow a similar approach in line with the Group’s overall approach to sustainability, making relevant modifications, to cater to their respective markets. Their respective sustainability reports contain this detail. 
					<br/><br/>
					Over the last year, three key changes were made to our central sustainability pillars. The changes are depicted in the diagram below.
