<div style="margin-top:10px;" class="justify" data-sr="enter bottom, move 20px">
Our e-commerce initiatives in Malaysia has been adapted for a comparatively different niche from Indonesia or Sri Lanka. In our attempt to make specific digitally enabled products accessible to our customers in Malaysia, 3 key e-commerce platforms were launched:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bolder;">achabooku:</span> Bachabooku is an ebook store offering a comprehensive collection of ebooks and emagazines to our Malaysian customers. The site provides reading access to the latest entertainment, lifestyle, and contents from a range of local and international publishers. Prices are 30 – 50% cheaper than regular bookstores.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Buzzaar:</span> Buzzaar is an online store which offers Malaysian specialty products from each state across the nation (Example: Kek Lapis (cake) from Sarawak, Handicraft from Sabah). Buzzaar provides a unique space for SME’s in Sabah and Sarawak to find a market for their products.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bolder;">The Crescent:</span> The Crescent is an integrated Islamic lifestyle infotainment and shopping online marketplace in one destination. It attracts the Malay Muslim demographics age 20 – 40 at sub-urban areas. You will find Islamic products such as Muslim-compliant clothing; beauty & personal care; fashion & prayer accessories; tudung/Hijab as well as Islamic art.

<div style="margin-top:20px;" class="title-orange" data-sr="enter bottom, move 20px">Digital marketplace in Sri Lanka</div>
<div style="margin-top:10px;" class="justify" data-sr="enter bottom, move 20px">
w<span style="font-weight:bolder;">ow.lk:</span> In 2008 Anything.lk started as a daily deal company in Sri Lanka. Since the collaboration with Dialog, the functions of daily deals have expanded to creating a better service under the name wow.lk. Currently, wow.lk has expanded and includes a wow mall as well. The wow mall is the incorporation of Anything.lk Retail Store and Dialog’s ibuy.lk. The online mega mall shelves over 3,000 products, from over 60 recognised businesses and delivers to all parts of Sri Lanka. The wow.lk platform ensures safe transactions and a warranty for goods where applicable.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bolder; font-family:axiataBold;">Beyond a digital market place ‘guru.lk’:</span> Online learning is an increasingly effective way to reach out to students in rural and remote areas with challenges in accessibility. In Sri Lanka, Dialog launched its first educational platform ‘e-teacher’ in 2012. This has since been revamped and launched as ‘guru.lk’. Dialog users can pay for the courses they have registered through Dialog Mobile, eZ cash or by credit card. In 2014, guru.lk advanced beyond formal educational content and introduced lifestyle courses such as, cookery (anyone can cook), auto (auto advice) and speaking English making it more applicable to a wider audience. Last year over 42,000 customers benefited from guru.lk services.
