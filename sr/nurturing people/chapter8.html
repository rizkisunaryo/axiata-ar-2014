            <p class="font15 text-justify">We nurture future leaders and drive exceptional performance across the Group by giving our 29,000 employees (excluding Idea and M1) the opportunity to participate in a broad range of training and personal development programmes. Programmes are influenced by employee feedback and are designed to promote personal and institutional growth. They seek to develop the capabilities and commitment of our staff to achieve Axiata’s business goals.</p>
            <p class="font15 text-justify">Our aim is to attract, develop and retain the best people by providing an inclusive workplace where talent is recognised and developed. Equal opportunities for all staff are promoted, discrimination of any kind is not condoned, and special measures are in place for those challenged by disability or personal circumstance.</p>
            <p class="font15 text-justify">By emphasising exceptional performance and integrity across the entire Group, Axiata strives to build a culture where our people are completely committed to the core values of the organisation. We recognize and reward those particularly exceptional performers through the Axiata Champions initiative.</p>
            <p class="font15 text-justify">

                    <p>Axiata’s talent development engine is on track to deliver a pool of strong and well-equipped leaders with the appropriate skills to ensure they deliver performance and in turn, contribute positively to the development and economic progress in their countries and communities. Led by the Axiata talent development programme, employees are offered numerous world-class training programmes regularly. The average no. of training hours per employee in 2014 was xx.</p>

                    <p>The Axiata Talent Development Programme which includes a joint programme with INSEAD (facilitated by INSEAD at its campus in Singapore); a Telco mini-MBA programme; and a ‘War Game’ business simulation programme, continued to strengthen and groom our employees in 2014. The Axiata Group and OpCo Accelerated Programmes (GADP and OADP) enabled high performers to accept challenges at the next level. More detailed information on our training programmes can be accessed at XXX</p>
                    <p>In 2014, the Group Talent management and development process of accelerated development, went through a process of improvement and decentralisation. This change was made in order to increase the interaction between selected employees and their respective superiors in each country. Specific training programmes were conducted to facilitate this change in the Talent Management Programme.</p>
                    <p>Last year a new process was introduced to facilitate the transition of top management into new roles at the CXO level. This includes a transition plan covering the first 100 days for each CXO level movement. This transition plan identifies the key factors and initiatives for the CXO to address and consider during his or her first 100 days. These improvements were made to enhance the capacity of top management and to test new talents within a challenging environment.</p>

                    <p>Our Employee Engagement Survey (conducted by an independent third party) is the primary method Axiata uses for engaging with its employees. The EES seeks detailed information from employees on a number of different indicators. Key findings on training and development, communication strategy and benefits, are shared with the management and employees. The goal of the EES is to build an environment where our people feel a sense of belonging, and are given the opportunity to grow and succeed.</p>
                    <p>For 2015, the EES will focus on ‘strategy, direction and objectives’ as being key drivers of the success of the Group. It will also consider Managerial Effectiveness as a vehicle for driving employee engagement at the ground level. An online planning tool will be introduced in 2015 to facilitate the monitoring of action plans across the group. The Group’s EEI score of 83% falls within the range of the Global High Performance companies.</p>
