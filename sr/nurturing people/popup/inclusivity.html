            <p class=" font15 text__color--grey text-justify">Axiata, is committed to promoting diversity and to attracting and retaining exceptional talent. We have more than 50 nationalities working across our OpCos and affiliates. We are committed to creating a dynamic and innovative workplace, in an endeavour to create digital ecosystems and advance Asia. Axiata fosters a climate of diversity and inclusiveness among employees by providing equal access and opportunities to our employees in terms of recruitment, retention, training and talent development processes.</p>
            <p class="axiataBold font17 text__color--blue">Equal Opportunity</p>
            <p class=" font15 text__color--grey text-justify">Axiata is an equal opportunity employer and is constantly streamlining workplace practices to ensure that women and men, people with disabilities, and other groups, have equal access to workplace environments, equal access to growth opportunities and equal access to self-development within the Group.</p>
            <p class=" font15 text__color--grey text-justify">Fostering equal opportunities for men and women is fundamental to our approach to sustainability. Our recruitment policy and talent development policy ensure that there are no barriers based on sex within the Group. The ‘equal pay for equal work’ principle is firmly entrenched in the way we treat our employees. There are no remuneration distinctions on the basis of sex at any of Axiata’s workplaces. The table on page 092 – 093 gives more details on the ratios within the workplace. The Group’s training programmes are open to both men and women and special measures are in place to cater to the needs of young mothers who may need to attend these programmes.</p>
