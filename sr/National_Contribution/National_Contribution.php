		Axiata group provides state of the art digital technology and through its investments contribute directly and indirectly to the economies of the countries in which it operates.

		Our 2014 Sustainability Report, similar to last year includes a National Contribution Report using methodology developed by an independent party. This year we have the same independent third party to assessing our contribution in our operating countries and provide updated data.<br />
		<br />
		This part of the report is based on the data generated by the independent third party as evidence of the contributions Axiata has made in 2014 in the several countries of Asia in which we operate.<br />
