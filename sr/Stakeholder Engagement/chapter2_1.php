                We constantly engage with our full range of stakeholders in multiple ways. Our goal is to see that their feedback helps us shape the ways we implement our sustainability processes within the Group. Each stakeholder has an important role to play in improving our sustainability operations in the different facets of our business.  In looking at materiality, we engage with those divisions within the Group that in turn engage with each relevant stakeholder.
