				<b>Idea</b><br/><br/>
				Idea is India’s third largest mobile operator and sixth largest, globally. It has over 150 million customers and its traffic exceeds 1.8 billion minutes every day. Today Idea is seeking to achieve excellence in sustainable business practices.
				<br/><br/>
				Presently, Idea’s approach to sustainability is built around five key areas:<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy and Emissions Management<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMF Radiation Management<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupational Health &amp; Safety<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable Supply Chain and Waste Management<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incident Management Tracking including Grievance Redress and 
					Whistle Blowing
				<br/><br/>
				Idea pioneered the search for Renewable Energy Technologies for fuelling cell sites in India, and has been at the forefront of adopting environmentally sustainable practices to reduce carbon emissions. It has also led efforts to reduce operating costs of telecommunications network operations in India through the use of renewable energies such as Hydrogen, Solar, and Battery-DG Hybrid systems.

				<h2>Spearheading Sustainability in the Telecommunications Sector</h2>
				The telecommunications industry has connected over 800 million Indians and revolutionised communications and information sharing in the country. At the same time the industry has realised it must lighten its carbon footprint. Realising the importance of sustainability within the telecommunications industry, Idea continues its lead in the search for greener energy options in India. Efficient power management, infrastructure sharing, use of eco-friendly renewable energy sources, leveraging the latest technology to reach out to a large audience in the most energy efficient manner such as video and teleconferencing, and smart logistics are some of the best practices in our network infrastructure and day-to-day business operations.
				<br/>
				<h2>Energy Consumption:</h2>
				<b>A Better Idea<br/>
				‘Sustainability through emission reduction and abatement.’</b>
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Initiatives</b>
				<br/><br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of solar power, fuel cells and other energy efficient measures at more than 1,950 sites resulted in
					an average carbon reduction of 24,000 tonnes per annum. The total installed capacity of Solar Generating plants
					at the Telecommunications Sites is in excess of 4.5 MW.<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling out of Mobile Switching Centre Solarisation initiated to reduce emissions<br/>
				•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiation of a Carbon Abatement Project against Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) consumption

				<h1>Greener is Better</h1>
Idea continues to work on enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing its carbon footprint.<br/>
<b>Major initiatives include:</b><br/>
<b>Infrastructure Sharing</b><br/>
Idea led Infrastructure Sharing within the Indian Telecommunications Industry. This led to the formation of a Tower Company called Indus Towers: a joint venture among the top three telecommunications companies in India. Idea, the leader in infrastructure sharing, led the industry with a tenancy ratio of 2.6 in its network portfolio of over 110,000 Sites.
<br/><br/>
<b>Energy efficient BTS</b>
In a bid to reduce energy consumption in BTS operations, Idea chose OD BTS (outdoor BTS) as the preferred BTS type in 2007. Today over 40% of Idea’s BTS portfolio comprises of OD BTS, the energy consumption of which is less than 25% over a conventional BTS.
<br/><br/>
In FY15, Idea converted indoor sites to outdoor sites by deploying a solution called Free Cooling Unit (FCU). 5,482 such conversions were completed in six months resulting in 25% savings in energy cost and an emission reduction of 32,000 tonnes of carbon per annum.
<br/><br/>
Over 19% of Idea’s own telecommunications towers (out of 9,500 own sites of Idea) are operational with hybrid solutions for energy reduction. Out of this about 1,000 sites are operational with solar solutions. This journey continues and this number will grow every month. Our goal to reduce CO2 emission of about 24,000 Tons per annum by end of FY15 has been achieved. Here the major objectives have been to reduce diesel generator running, and reduce diesel consumption, to less than five hours a day.
<br/><br/>
Idea is the only telecommunications company in India where 25 sites operate with Hydrogen fuel cells. If Hydrogen can be made more widely available and at lower costs, this programme has the potential of eliminating the need for regular diesel generators.
<br/><br/>
<h1>When you have a subscriber base of nearly 100 million, communication is key</h1>
Idea launched an attractive campaign, ‘Use Mobile, Save Paper’ campaign to encourage consumers to reduce paper usage. Idea was amongst the first mobile operators in India to promote virtual top up recharges for prepaid users, which led to the phasing out of paper-based recharge vouchers, saving tonnes of paper.
<br/><br/>
Idea became one of the first operators, globally, to introduce the PICO card replacing traditional SIM cards which were embedded into large pieces of plastic. This initiative is expected to save over 90% of plastic used in manufacturing regular cards.
<br/><br/>

All communications to our shareholders and investors are sent through e-mail reducing our printing and mailing costs and making a concrete impact on the environment. Idea promotes e-Billing for post-paid customers to reduce usage of paper.
<br/><br/>

<h1>Employees: Flag bearers of Sustainability</h1>
Idea’s Human Resources operations and communications to its employee base of 15,000 are mainly done online through smart ICT solutions such as teleconferencing, videoconferencing, web chats, and internal social networking platforms to minimise commute time and increase productivity.
<br/><br/>

Through the ‘Bus Karo’ programme, our employees use a pool bus service to commute to and from the office during peak hours, every day. One such bus takes the place of approximately 30 cars, saving over 1,200 tonnes of carbon emissions, per annum.
