              Axiata Group Berhad (Axiata) is one of the largest Asian telecommunications groups in Asia with over 260 million customers. Axiata’s vision is to be a regional champion by 2015 by piecing together the best throughout the region in connectivity, technology and talent, uniting them towards a single goal: Advancing Asia.<br />
              <br />
              Axiata has controlling interests in mobile operators in Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia with significant strategic stakes in India and Singapore. In addition, the Malaysian-grown holding company has a stake in non-mobile telecommunications operations in Pakistan. <br />
              <br />
              The Group’s mobile subsidiaries and associates operate under the brand name “Celcom” in Malaysia, “XL” in Indonesia, “Dialog” in Sri Lanka, “Robi” in Bangladesh, “Smart” in Cambodia, “Idea” in India and “M1” in Singapore. Added to this, the Group has established a communications infrastructure solutions and services company called “edotco”. <br />
              <br />
              The Group revenue for 2014 was RM18.7 billion (USD5.7 billion). Its market capitalisation stood at over RM60.5 billion (USD18.5 billion) at the end of 2014.<br />
              <br />
              The Group provides employment to over 25,000 people across Asia.<br />
              <br />
              Axiata was awarded the Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific ICT Award for Best Telecom Group for six consecutive years in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and the Telecom Asia Best Regional Mobile Group 2010 and 2011 for its operations in multiple Asian markets. In 2011, Axiata was the only Malaysian company to make the Forbes Asia Fab 50 List.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <span class="title" style="line-height:2; color:#fff;">Axiata’s Journey</span><br />
              Axiata was incorporated in Malaysia on 12 June 1992 as a private limited company under the name of TMI, operating as a division within TM. In 2008, the TM Group completed a strategic demerger exercise which resulted in an enhanced TMI, which was merged with Celcom. TMI was subsequently listed on Bursa Securities on 28 April 2008 and in March 2009, TMI changed its name to Axiata Group Berhad and launched a new identity, enhancing its position as a leading regional mobile operator. The move was a requisite step to reinforce the Group’s new business philosophy and its commitment to advancing Asia by addressing the unfulfilled communication needs of local populations with affordable and innovative products and services. Axiata has gone from 40 million customers, pre-demerger, to over 260 million across eight countries, in seven years, making Axiata one of the largest mobile players in Asia.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <span class="title" style="line-height:2; color:#fff;">Shaping the Future</span><br />
              Axiata has always been ahead of the curve, quickly adapting to change and positioning its business model to capitalise on the developments in an increasingly digitalised world. Parallel to its investments in network and technology modernisation over the years, Axiata has also evolved its business to embrace the digital age and fast growing demand for data. 2015 will be a critical year for Axiata as it progresses in its transformation beyond a traditional telecommunications company.<br />
              <br />
              In advancing Asia, Axiata remains committed to its role as a responsible corporate citizen, to make a difference to people’s lives and help transform the countries in which it operates. Further details of Axiata’s sustainability efforts are now available online.

              In 2008, the TM Group completed a strategic demerger exercise that saw the separation of the mobile business from TM. The demerger resulted in an enhanced TMI, which was merged with Celcom, enabling it to focus on its own core business and accelerate operational improvements and growth initiatives; emerging as an independent entity in the regional mobile telecommunications market.<br>
              <br>
              TMI was subsequently listed on Bursa Securities on 28 April 2008, marking a new chapter in its transformation towards  becoming a regional giant in the mobile communications market.<br>

The move was a requisite step to reinforce the Group’s new business philosophy and its commitment to advancing Asia by addressing the unfulfilled communication needs of local populations with affordable and innovative products and services. Axiata has blazed a path across the region; from 40 million customers, pre-demerger, to over 240 million across 9 countries, in six years, making Axiata one of the largest mobile players in Asia.<br>
